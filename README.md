# Bostonography
My Final Project for Bostonography

This is a webapp build using Flask, Leaflet.js, Mapbox, and Bootstrap. It's for my final project for Bostonography, a class at Northeastern Univerisity that I highly recommend. If you want to know more about how I approached the project or help contribute to it, by all means fork the repo and make this into something great. A live demo can be seen at https://bostonography.herokuapp.com/
